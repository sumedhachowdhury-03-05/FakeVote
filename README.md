🗳️ Fake Vote Recognition System

A machine-learning powered system designed to detect fake, duplicate, or suspicious votes by analyzing voting patterns and identifying anomalies in real time.

This project demonstrates how AI can bring transparency, verification, and security to digital voting platforms — ensuring fair results without manual intervention.

📜 Project Description

The Fake Vote Recognition System analyzes incoming votes based on IP activity, device patterns, timestamp behavior, and other engineered features to determine whether a vote is legitimate or fraudulent.

Machine learning models classify votes as:

✅ Real Vote

❌ Fake / Suspicious Vote

All predictions, features, and logs can be stored and inspected for full transparency and auditability.

⚠️ Note: This demo uses basic pattern-based ML and simple anomaly detection. For production systems, stronger security, cryptographic identity checks, and advanced models are required.

⚙️ What It Does

Processes raw voting data

Cleans & encodes it through preprocessing

Extracts key behavioral features (IP frequency, device ID reuse, vote timing)

Runs ML models (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / Isolation Forest)

Flags each vote as real or fake

Provides visual analytics of voting patterns

💡 Pro Tip

Start small — train the model, test predictions, improve features, and iterate.
Real fraud detection improves continuously as more data and patterns are analyzed.
